# My nixos system configurations

## Hosts

_Status badges run through forest, so all badges showing red probably means forest is down._

### forest ![forest status](https://img.shields.io/website?label=forest&up_color=green&up_message=online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fforest.maxwofford.com%2Fstatus%2Fforest)

Forest is a cheap digital-ocean droplet that connects my computers to the outside world. Converted from ubuntu to nixos with [nix-infect](https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect/blob/master/nixos-infect).

### water-lily ![water-lily status](https://img.shields.io/website?label=water-lily&up_color=green&up_message=online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fforest.maxwofford.com%2Fstatus%2Fwater-lily)

Water-lily is a partition of Sequoia running nixos- it's where I do most development & experiment with nixos the most.

### guava

A 2017 intel macbook pro. The screen broke, so it's now running as a media server in my closet.

### rubber

The M1 macbook air I switched to after using guava. My main computer while on the move.

### watermelon

A synology NAS currently configured with 8TB of RAID storage (~16TB of drives)-- it can hold a lot.
